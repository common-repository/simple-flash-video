Simple Stats Version 1.2.2
==========================
Simple Stats is a simple to install and easy to use statistics package for Jeroen Wijering's FLV player. It originally started as a simple Ruby script and has since evolved into a high quality professional package that is much, much faster through the use of aggressive caching and smarter code.

Simple stats consists of Javascript, PHP, and Python components. The Javascript component gathers statistics while the PHP and Python components log and process the log, respectively.

You can view a live demo of Simple Stats that is using a log file with 100,000 entries at:

Please note that currently Simple Stats works ONLY for videos hosted on the same domain as the Simple Stats scripts because of browser restrictions (cross-site request restrictions to prevent attacks).
