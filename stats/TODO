Simple Stats TODO
=================
A list of things to be done at some point.
 
 * Volume map per region for specific files
 
 * Show what container and streams are for the file
    - this requires parsing file headers with a little python magic
 
 * Create js for embeds to ajax starts as hits to the log
    - better than nothing I suppose...

 * Cron job setup

 * levenshtein searching

 * OpenFlashChart 2

 * python version check
 * document title -> filename usage by ss
